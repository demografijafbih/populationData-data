If a child dies soon after the birth, it is first registered as a live-born and then as an infant death. Death is the permanent disappearance of all evidence od life at any time after livebirth has taken place (postnatal cessation of vital functions with no possibility of resuscitation). This definition excludes foetal deaths, which are defined separately. Natural increase or fall is the difference (surplus or deficit) between the number of livebirths and the number of dead persons in the reference year.","computation_calculations":"J=N-M \n J- Natural increase \n N- Number of live births \n M- Number of deaths","national_geographical_coverage":"Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, cantons.","comments_limitations":"Data for the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina are the sum of data for cantons.","page_content":"","national_metadata_updated_date":"2024-10-29","national_data_updated_date":"2024-10-29","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2024-10-29: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/demografijafbih/populationData-data/commit/185bafb9018c647bdad85980e6ec1e5368e6ce40","national_data_update_url_text":"2024-10-29: see changes on GitHub","national_data_update_url":"https://github.com/demografijafbih/populationData-data/commit/185bafb9018c647bdad85980e6ec1e5368e6ce40","indicator":"1.1.1"}
