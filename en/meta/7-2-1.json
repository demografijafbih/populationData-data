The relative poverty line is set at 60% of the median equalized monthly expenses for consumption. Poverty is therefore defined in a relative sense and depends on the distribution of consumption expenditures within the population. Poverty does not mean only the lack of necessary goods and services, but also the unfavorable status in which some households find themselves when compared to others: the poor are those who own less.","Quality_assurance":"metadata_fields.quality_assurance_7_2_1","Comparability_with_international_data":"metadata_fields.","page_content":"","national_metadata_updated_date":"2023-11-28","national_data_updated_date":"2023-11-28","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2023-11-28: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/demografijafbih/populationData-data/commit/22eaaaf2d339a5e91ba9f1b38c47aae8df3d27a9","national_data_update_url_text":"2023-11-28: see changes on GitHub","national_data_update_url":"https://github.com/demografijafbih/populationData-data/commit/22eaaaf2d339a5e91ba9f1b38c47aae8df3d27a9","indicator":"7.2.1"}
