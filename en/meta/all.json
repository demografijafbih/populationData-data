The relative poverty line is set at 60% of the median equalized monthly expenses for consumption. Poverty is therefore defined in a relative sense and depends on the distribution of consumption expenditures within the population. Poverty does not mean only the lack of necessary goods and services, but also the unfavorable status in which some households find themselves when compared to others: the poor are those who own less.","quality_assurance":"For several reasons, this type of survey has limited value in poverty analysis. The survey refers to individuals living in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and does not include persons living in collective institutions (nursing homes, correctional homes, prisons, etc.). In addition, the homeless are also excluded because the sample was made based on the framework of inhabited housing units. Therefore, the survey cannot provide information about living conditions in extremely poor situations. But regardless, the survey remains the main source of information for poverty estimates in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and must be used as a reference for any analysis of this phenomenon.","comparability_with_international_data":"For the poverty analysis presented in this chapter, the European standard methodology was used. According to this methodology, poverty is defined by equivalent household consumption expenditures that are below the standard threshold, which is annually set at 60.0% of the median monthly equalized household expenditures. This definition was adopted at the level of the European Union as a working definition in 1984 according to the decision of the Council of Europe, and reads: -Poor persons, families and groups of persons whose resources (material, cultural and social) are limited to such an extent that they exclude them from the the minimum required for living in the member country in which they live.","other_information":"Definitely poor are those households with consumption expenditure below 50% of the median adjusted expenditure.Scarcely poor households are those with consumption expenditure between 50% and 60% of the median adjusted expenditure.Households at risk of poverty are those with consumption expenditure between 60% and 70% of the median adjusted expenditure.","page_content":"","national_metadata_updated_date":"2024-09-23","national_data_updated_date":"2024-09-23","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2024-09-23: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/demografijafbih/populationData-data/commit/bb221cc33eedc1568fa58f317b103d09af78a8f0","national_data_update_url_text":"2024-09-23: see changes on GitHub","national_data_update_url":"https://github.com/demografijafbih/populationData-data/commit/bb221cc33eedc1568fa58f317b103d09af78a8f0","indicator":"7.3.1"},"5-6-3":{"indicator_number":"5.6.3","sdg_goal":"5","data_non_statistical":false,"goal_meta_link":null,"goal_meta_link_text":null,"graph_title":"Students graduated in doctoral studies by sex","graph_type":"line","indicator_name":"Students graduated in doctoral studies by sex","indicator_sort_order":"05-06-03","published":true,"reporting_status":"complete","target_name":"University education (3rd level)","target_id":"5.6","un_custodian_agency":null,"un_designated_tier":"5","data_show_map":false,"source_active_1":true,"source_url_text_1":"Link to source","source_active_2":false,"source_url_text_2":"Link to Source","source_active_3":false,"source_url_3":"Link to source","source_active_4":false,"source_url_text_4":"Link to source","source_active_5":false,"source_url_text_5":"Link to source","source_active_6":false,"source_url_text_6":"Link to source","title":"Untitled","source_organisation_1":"FZS","source_url_1":null,"page_content":"","national_metadata_updated_date":"2024-09-23","national_data_updated_date":"2024-09-23","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2024-09-23: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/demografijafbih/populationData-data/commit/bb221cc33eedc1568fa58f317b103d09af78a8f0","national_data_update_url_text":"2024-09-23: see changes on GitHub","national_data_update_url":"https://github.com/demografijafbih/populationData-data/commit/bb221cc33eedc1568fa58f317b103d09af78a8f0","indicator":"5.6.3"},"3-1-4":{"indicator_number":"3.1.4","sdg_goal":"3","data_non_statistical":false,"goal_meta_link":null,"goal_meta_link_text":null,"graph_title":"Stillbirths by sex","graph_type":"line","indicator_name":"Stillbirths by sex","indicator_sort_order":"03-01-04","published":true,"reporting_status":"complete","target_name":"Mortality and causes of death","target_id":"3.1","un_custodian_agency":"Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)","un_designated_tier":"1","data_show_map":false,"source_active_1":true,"source_url_text_1":"Link to source","source_active_2":false,"source_url_text_2":"Link to Source","source_active_3":false,"source_url_3":"Link to source","source_active_4":false,"source_url_text_4":"Link to source","source_active_5":false,"source_url_text_5":"Link to source","source_active_6":false,"source_url_text_6":"Link to source","title":"Untitled","source_organisation_1":"FZS","source_url_1":"https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/indicators/database/","page_content":"","national_metadata_updated_date":"2024-09-23","national_data_updated_date":"2024-09-23","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2024-09-23: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/demografijafbih/populationData-data/commit/bb221cc33eedc1568fa58f317b103d09af78a8f0","national_data_update_url_text":"2024-09-23: see changes on GitHub","national_data_update_url":"https://github.com/demografijafbih/populationData-data/commit/bb221cc33eedc1568fa58f317b103d09af78a8f0","indicator":"3.1.4"},"1-1-1":{"indicator_number":"1.1.1","sdg_goal":"1","data_non_statistical":false,"graph_title":"Vital statistics by sex (live births, deaths, natural change)","graph_type":"line","indicator_name":"Vital statistics by sex (live births, deaths, natural change)","indicator_sort_order":"01-01-01","published":true,"reporting_status":"complete","target_name":"Natural change of population","target_id":"1.1","un_custodian_agency":"World Bank (WB);

Each geographically separated unit (department) of the same type is also considered a school (school division/department).A classroom/department represents a group of students who study at the same time and in the same room during one school year, either from one or more teachers. The final grade is the grade in which the student finishes his education at that school. A repeater is a student who enrolls in the same class a second time or more than once. A student sent to repeat a grade is a student who at the end of the school year received a negative grade in three or more subjects (according to the regulations for that type of school) or who does not pass the remedial or class exam at the end of the school year.
