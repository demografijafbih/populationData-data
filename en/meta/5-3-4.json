Each geographically separated unit (department) of the same type is also considered a school (school division/department).A classroom/department represents a group of students who study at the same time and in the same room during one school year, either from one or more teachers. The final grade is the grade in which the student finishes his education at that school. A repeater is a student who enrolls in the same class a second time or more than once. A student sent to repeat a grade is a student who at the end of the school year received a negative grade in three or more subjects (according to the regulations for that type of school) or who does not pass the remedial or class exam at the end of the school year. Teachers are professionals who directly implement various programs of basic education with children.","national_geographical_coverage":"Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina.","page_content":"","national_metadata_updated_date":"2023-12-12","national_data_updated_date":"2023-12-12","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2023-12-12: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/demografijafbih/populationData-data/commit/b6b9d69032f3e1f58837d939e14636824cceb5e7","national_data_update_url_text":"2023-12-12: see changes on GitHub","national_data_update_url":"https://github.com/demografijafbih/populationData-data/commit/b6b9d69032f3e1f58837d939e14636824cceb5e7","indicator":"5.3.4"}
